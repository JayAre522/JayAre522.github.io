### TIGERS AROUND THE WORLD
#### There are many tigers around the world. They originally originated in Africa, but then migrated all over. Mainly in Asia, over 2 million years ago. They are the most iconic of the big cat family. In the wild, there is an estimated 3, 890 tigers left. Poachers have been killing tigers for years. There are nine different subspecies in the tiger family, three of these are extinct. Tigers are the largest of all Asian big cats, weighing in at up to 660 pounds. The smallest of tiger subspecies—the Sumatran tiger—weighs about 310 pounds. Tigers are the most interesting cat out in the wild. Like human finger prints, each tiger has their own unique stripes. In the wild, they live up to be twenty-six years old but can live longer if kept in a sanctury with the right resources. As of today, poacher are trying to sell tiger parts on the animal black market. It is our job to keep our tigers and their habitats in the wild safe.
